# face-memory

# Big Picture
A program that recognizes faces and remembers them. 

# First Steps
Use open cv to recognize a face.
Use pygame to display face tracking on a screen.

# Test Plan
1. User sits in front of camara. Program communicates somehow that it sees a face. When nothing is in front of camara, program does not communicate.
2. When user is in front of camera, the user's image is displayed on a screen and an outline is displayed incidcating a face. When not in front of camara, screen just shows background.
